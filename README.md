## Devops Principle 
1. Principles of Flow
2. Principles of Feedback
3. Principles of Continual Learning and Experimentation

### Principles of Flow
We need fast and smooth flow of work from Deployment to Operations. Our goal is to decrease the time required for changes to be deployed into production and increase reliability and quality of those services

How can we do this? 
1. Make our work visible- One of the ways we can do this is using visual work boards, such as kanban boards or sprint planning boards, where we can represent our work.

2. Limit work in process(WIP)- This can be understood with an example lets say we can set WIP of three cards for testing. When there are three cards in the test lane, no new cards should be added unless a card is complete or removed from the "in work" column 
Although it may be tempting to start new work but it is better to identify what is causing the delay and try to fix the problem.

3. Reduce batch sizes
   3.1. Large Batch Strategy(Mass Production) - sequentially perform one operation on each batch of code changes or artifacts.So if we were to prepare 10 envelopes, we would         first fold all 10 sheets, insert each of them, seal all 10 and then stamp them all. 
   3.2. Small Batch Strategy- all the operations required to be completed must be performed before moving on to the next.  So if we were to prepare 10 envelopes, we would             fold a sheet of paper, insert it, seal it and stamp it. Only then we will move to the next sheet
4. Reduce the number of handoffs
5. Continually identify and elevate our constraints
6. Eliminate Hardships and waste in the value stream
